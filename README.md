# Etch-a-Sketch

Welcome to the Etch-a-Sketch project! This interactive web application allows users to create drawings on a grid with customizable features such as pen color, grid size, and drawing modes.

## Features

- **Change Pen Color**: Click the "Change Pen Color" button to set the pen color to a random color.
- **Toggle Color Mode**: Switch between single color mode and random color mode.
- **Change Grid Size**: Adjust the size of the drawing grid by specifying a new size (e.g., 50 for a 50x50 grid).
- **Opacity/Darken Mode**: Toggle darkening mode to gradually increase the opacity of the drawing as you draw.
- **Eraser Mode**: Switch between drawing and erasing modes to clear sections of the grid.

## How It Works

1. **Grid Creation**: The grid is dynamically created based on user input. Each cell in the grid has an overlay that supports the darkening effect.
2. **Pen and Eraser Modes**: The pen color can be changed, and you can toggle between drawing and erasing modes using the buttons.
3. **Darkening Effect**: When darkening mode is enabled, the opacity of the grid cells increases as you draw.
